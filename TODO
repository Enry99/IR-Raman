IR: fix plotIR for python3, add plotting with matplotlib.

IR: Standardize the broadening method: check between ase, the method in the ir script and the broaden.py for raman

Raman: parallelize the code

Raman: check broadening, filter imaginary frequencies

General script: read a bare incar, add the right flags for phonons:
 IBRION = 7
 NSW = 1
 NELMIN=10
 NWRITE = 3      ! for IR and Raman

 LEPSILON=.TRUE. ! for IR


and for Raman:
 LEPSILON = .TRUE.


The directory must contain the bare incar, poscar, potcar and kpoints.
The script first launches phonons dfpt calc, creating a phonons folder.
When it has finished, with another command, we create a raman folder, and inside we launch
all the displacement in parallel, each in its own folder

At the end of phonons and/or raman, one can extract the spectra, save them to txt and plot them (set a variable for plot range in settings.json)
